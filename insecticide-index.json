            "description": "Bayer Advanced Complete (also sold under the BioAdvanced brand) is a dual-action lawn insecticide specifically formulated to tackle both surface-dwelling and soil-buried pests in turf and garden areas. Its active ingredients, imidacloprid and beta-cyfluthrin, work together: the surface insects (such as ants, ticks, fleas, chinch bugs and mole crickets) are killed within about 24 hours, while below-ground pests (like grubs and crane fly larvae) receive up to 90 days of control. Available as dry granules or a convenient ready-to-spray concentrate, it covers approximately 5,000 sq ft per quart (RTS form) or up to 10,000 sq ft per 10-pound bag (granular form) depending on the pest and application method. Both forms are pet-safe when used according to the label instructions, and the ready-to-spray option eliminates measuring or mixing. There have been no formulation changes since Bayer's sale of its home-garden division to BioAdvanced, and the product has retained the same chemical composition despite rebranding.",
            "application": "To apply Bayer Advanced Complete Insect Killer to your lawn, first choose the appropriate form (granules or ready-to-spray liquid). For granules, use a broadcast spreader to evenly distribute the product over dry grass, then immediately water the area to activate the ingredients. For the ready-to-spray version, connect the bottle to a garden hose, turn on the water, and spray evenly across your lawn until it's lightly saturated. Apply when the lawn is dry and no rain is expected for at least 24 hours, unless watering is required. Always follow the label instructions for application rates and safety precautions.",
            "legality": "In Canada, Bayer Advanced Complete, which contains the active ingredients imidacloprid and beta-cyfluthrin, is not legal for use on lawns or turf. Health Canada's Pest Management Regulatory Agency cancelled all non-agricultural turf and foliar uses of imidacloprid as of May 19, 2023. This means applications on lawns, including typical home use products, are unauthorized and prohibited in Canada. <br><br>Health Canada requires that all pesticides be registered and used strictly in accordance with their labels. Using a pesticide for an unregistered application is a violation of the Pest Control Products Act and may result in enforcement action. Furthermore, consumer reports on platforms like Reddit indicate that systemic insecticides such as imidacloprid are generally not available for retail sale in Canada, and acquiring them via international import can lead to seizure by border authorities or large fines, particularly if done without proper licensing",
            "pros": "Bayer Advanced Complete has several advantages for homeowners looking to control lawn pests. It provides fast and long-lasting protection, killing surface insects like ants and ticks within 24 hours and controlling soil pests like grubs for up to three months. The product comes in both granular and ready-to-spray liquid forms, making application flexible and convenient. It also treats a wide range of pests in a single step, reducing the need for multiple products. When used correctly, it helps keep lawns healthy and free of damaging insects.",
            "cons": "Bayer Advanced Complete also comes with a few drawbacks. Its active ingredients, particularly imidacloprid, have raised environmental concerns due to their potential impact on pollinators like bees and on beneficial insects. It is not approved for lawn use in Canada, limiting availability and legality in certain regions. Overuse or improper application can lead to runoff and contamination of nearby water sources. Additionally, while effective, it is a chemical solution that may not suit those looking for organic or eco-friendly pest control options.",

It works by breaking down the outer shell of insects, causing them to dehydrate and die quickly, usually within minutes. This product is favored by gardeners looking for a more environmentally friendly option, as it contains no harsh chemicals and is safe to use around people and pets when used as directed. It is also OMRI-listed for organic gardening, making it suitable for those following organic practices. However, because it only works on direct contact, thorough coverage and repeated applications may be necessary for full control.",
            "application": "To apply Bonide Insecticidal Soap to your lawn, start by making sure the area is well-watered and not under stress from heat or drought. Attach the hose-end sprayer if using the ready-to-spray version, or mix the concentrate according to the label instructions if using a handheld sprayer. Spray the solution directly onto affected areas, focusing on spots where pests are active. Be sure to coat the insects thoroughly, as the product only works on contact. Apply early in the morning or late in the evening to avoid leaf burn, and repeat every 7 to 10 days as needed. Avoid spraying in direct sunlight or when rain is expected within a few hours.",
            "legality": "In Canada, Bonide Insecticidal Soap is generally legal for use on ornamental plants, flowers, vegetables, and houseplants, provided it is registered with Health Canada's Pest Management Regulatory Agency (PMRA) and used according to the label instructions. The product is typically registered under the brand name Safer's Insecticidal Soap. However, it is not approved for use on lawns or turf. Specifically, the PMRA has not registered insecticidal soap products for controlling pests like chinch bugs on lawns, even though such use is permitted in the United States. This discrepancy means that using insecticidal soap on lawns in Canada is not legal and could be considered a violation of the Pest Control Products Act.",

It works quickly by breaking down the pests' outer protective layer, leading to rapid dehydration and death. Because it is made from fatty acids, it is considered safer for people, pets, and beneficial insects when used as directed. The product is also approved for organic gardening, making it a popular choice for those seeking environmentally friendly pest control options.",
            "cons": "Bonide Insecticidal Soap has some limitations to consider. It only works on insects it directly contacts, so thorough and frequent applications are often necessary to achieve full control. It may not be effective against tougher or hard-shelled pests. Additionally, it can sometimes cause leaf burn or damage if applied in hot, sunny weather or to sensitive plants. Because it breaks down quickly, its effects are short-lived, requiring repeated treatments to keep pests in check.",

Its active ingredients, pyrethrins and piperonyl butoxide (PBO), are not registered for use on lawns in Canada, making such applications illegal and potentially subject to regulatory penalties. Additionally, pyrethrins are broad-spectrum insecticides, meaning they can harm beneficial insects like bees and ladybugs, especially if applied during active pollination periods. Environmental factors such as temperature and humidity can also influence its effectiveness and potential phytotoxicity. Lastly, while pyrethrins are derived from chrysanthemums and are biodegradable, they can still pose risks to aquatic life if runoff occurs.

            "application": "To apply OnGuard Pro-Perm to your lawn, first dilute the product according to the label instructions. Use a garden sprayer to evenly apply the solution across the entire lawn area, focusing on spots where pests are commonly found.

            "cons": "OnGuard Pro-Perm is effective but has some drawbacks. Its residual effect lasts up to 60 days but can be reduced if the treated area gets wet, requiring reapplication. It kills pests on contact but doesn't repel them, so new insects can still enter treated spaces. The product can harm beneficial insects like bees, so it must be used carefully. It may be less effective against some pests such as bedbugs, and since permethrin is toxic to cats, pets need to be kept away from treated areas. Additionally, some users feel its lower concentration may not provide the best value compared to stronger alternatives.",

Best applied in spring (April-May), mid-summer (late June-August), or late summer to early fall (August-September), this timing aligns with peak larval activity for both preventative and curative applications. After spreading the granules using a lawn spreader, it must be watered in (about 1.25 cm of water) to activate the bacteria and move it into the soil root zone.

It contains permethrin (0.25%), a synthetic pyrethroid that targets the nervous system of spiders, causing paralysis and death. The product also includes rosemary essential oil, leaving behind a pleasant residual aroma. Wilson Spider Out is available in two formulations: a pump spray for targeted application in cracks and crevices, and an aerosol spray that can be used from any angle to reach hard-to-access areas. Both versions are effective on contact and provide residual protection for up to a week when applied in shaded areas. They are safe for humans and pets when used as directed and are suitable for use around doorways, windows, patios, and other common entry points.",
            "application": "To apply Wilson Spider Out to your lawn, shake the bottle well before use and spray directly onto areas where spiders and webs are visible, such as around shrubs, garden beds, and outdoor structures. For best results, apply during calm weather to prevent the spray from drifting and avoid watering or rain for at least 24 hours after application to allow the insecticide to work effectively. Keep pets and children away from treated areas until the spray has fully dried. Repeat applications as needed to maintain control.",
            "legality": "Wilson Spider Out is a legally registered pesticide in Canada. It has been approved by Health Canada's Pest Management Regulatory Agency (PMRA) under the Pest Control Products Act, with the registration number 31900. This registration ensures that the product has been evaluated for safety and efficacy when used according to the label directions. Therefore, it is legal to purchase and use Wilson Spider Out across Canada, including in Ontario.",
            "pros": "Wilson Spider Out offers several advantages for homeowners seeking effective spider control. Its active ingredient, permethrin, acts swiftly to eliminate spiders upon contact, making it ideal for immediate intervention. The product is versatile, suitable for both indoor and outdoor applications, including areas like patios, doorways, and window frames. Its formulation includes rosemary essential oil, leaving behind a pleasant aroma and enhancing user experience. Additionally, Wilson Spider Out is available in both aerosol and ready-to-use spray formats, providing flexibility to address various needs and preferences.",
            "cons": "Wilson Spider Out has some drawbacks to consider. It contains permethrin, a synthetic chemical that can be toxic to beneficial insects like bees and aquatic life if not used carefully. The spray may also irritate skin, eyes, or respiratory systems, so protective measures should be taken during application. It provides only temporary control, requiring repeated applications to keep spiders away. Additionally, care must be taken to avoid overuse to prevent environmental impact and potential development of insect resistance.",
